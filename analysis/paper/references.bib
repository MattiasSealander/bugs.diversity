  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without  replacement), which is the current standard method for normalization, has been  widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the  community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers  explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. Here we introduce a  normalization method for species count data called scaling with ranked  subsampling (SRS) and demonstrate its suitability for the analysis of microbial  communities. METHODS: SRS consists of two steps. In the scaling step, the counts  for all species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are divided by a scaling  factor chosen in such a way that the sum of scaled counts equals the selected  total number of counts C(min). The relative frequencies of all OTUs remain  unchanged. In the subsequent ranked subsampling step, non-integer count values  are converted into integers by an algorithm that minimizes subsampling error with  regard to the population structure (relative frequencies of species or OTUs)  while keeping the total number of counts equal C(min). SRS and rarefying were  compared by normalizing a test library representing a soil bacterial community.  Common parameters of biodiversity and population structure (Shannon index H',  species richness, species composition, and relative abundances of OTUs) were  determined for libraries normalized to different size by rarefying as well as SRS  with 10,000 replications each. An implementation of SRS in R is available for  download (https://doi.org/10.20387/BONARES-2657-1NP3). RESULTS: SRS showed  greater reproducibility and preserved OTU frequencies and alpha diversity better  than rarefying. The variance in Shannon diversity increased with the reduction of  the library size after rarefying but remained zero for SRS. Relative abundances  of OTUs strongly varied among libraries generated by rarefying, whereas libraries  normalized by SRS showed only negligible variation. Bray-Curtis index of  dissimilarity among replicates of the same library normalized by rarefying  revealed a large variation in species composition, which reached complete  dissimilarity (not a single OTU shared) among some libraries rarefied to a small  size. The dissimilarity among replicated libraries normalized by SRS remained  negligibly low at each library size. The variance in dissimilarity increased with  the decreasing library size after rarefying, whereas it remained either zero or  negligibly low after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of OTU or species counts by  scaling with ranked subsampling preserves the original community structure by  minimizing subsampling errors. We therefore propose SRS for the normalization of  biological count data.},

  abstract = {Climate warming is expected to cause a poleward spread of species, resulting in increased richness at mid to high latitudes and weakening the latitudinal diversity gradient. We used pollen data to test if such a change in the latitudinal diversity gradient occurred during the last major poleward shift of plant species in Europe following the end of the last glacial period. In contrast to expectations, the slope of the gradient strengthened during the Holocene. The increase in temperatures around 10\,ka ago reduced diversity at mid to high latitude sites due to the gradual closure of forests. Deforestation and the introduction of agriculture during the last 5\,ky had a greater impact on richness in central Europe than the earlier climate warming. These results do not support the current view that global warming alone will lead to a loss in biodiversity, and demonstrate that non-climatic human impacts on the latitudinal diversity gradient is of a greater magnitude than climate change.}

  abstract = {Author Summary The term microbiome refers to the ecosystem of microbes that live in a defined environment. The decreasing cost and increasing speed of DNA sequencing technology has recently provided scientists with affordable and timely access to the genes and genomes of microbiomes that inhabit our planet and even our own bodies. In these investigations many microbiome samples are sequenced at the same time on the same DNA sequencing machine, but often result in total numbers of sequences per sample that are vastly different. The common procedure for addressing this difference in sequencing effort across samples – different library sizes – is to either (1) base analyses on the proportional abundance of each species in a library, or (2) rarefy, throw away sequences from the larger libraries so that all have the same, smallest size. We show that both of these normalization methods can work when comparing obviously-different whole microbiomes, but that neither method works well when comparing the relative proportions of each bacterial species across microbiome samples. We show that alternative methods based on a statistical mixture model perform much better and can be easily adapted from a separate biological sub-discipline, called RNA-Seq analysis.}

Understanding the  timing, geographical patterns and drivers of past changes in insect communities  is essential for evaluating the biodiversity implications of future climate  changes, yet our knowledge of long-term patterns is limited. We applied a network  modelling approach to the recent fossil record of northwestern European beetles  to investigate how their taxonomic and trait composition changed during the past  16 000 years. We found two major changes in beetle faunas 4000-3500 and 10  000-9500 years ago, coinciding with periods of human population growth in the  Late Holocene and climate warming in the Early Holocene. Our results demonstrate  that humans have affected insect biodiversity since at least the introduction of  agropastoralism, with landscape-scale effects that can be observed at sites away  from areas of direct human impact.},

  abstract = {[In this paper a methodology is presented for measuring diversity based on rarefaction of actual samples. By the use of this technique, a within-habitat analysis was made of the bivalve and polychaete components of soft-bottom marine faunas which differed in latitude, depth, temperature, and salinity. The resulting diversity values were highly correlated with the physical stability and past history of these environments. A stability-time hypothesis was invoked to fit these findings, and, with this hypothesis, predictions were made about the diversities present in certain other environments as yet unstudied. The two types of diversity, based on numerical percentage composition and on number of species, were compared and shown to be poorly correlated with each other. Our data indicated that species number is the more valid diversity measurement. The rarefaction methodology was compared with a number of diversity indexes using identical data. Many of these indexes were markedly influenced by sample size. Good agreement was found between the rarefaction methodology and the Shannon-Wiener information function.]}

  abstract = {¡p¿Understanding the drivers of diversity is a fundamental question in ecology. Extensive literature discusses different methods for describing diversity and documenting its effects on ecosystem health and function. However, it is widely believed that diversity depends on the intensity of sampling. I discuss a statistical perspective on diversity, framing the diversity of an environment as an unknown parameter, and discussing the bias and variance of plug-in and rarefied estimates. I describe the state of the statistical literature for addressing these problems, focusing on the analysis of microbial diversity. I argue that latent variable models can address issues with variance, but bias corrections need to be utilized as well. I encourage ecologists to use estimates of diversity that account for unobserved species, and to use measurement error models to compare diversity across ecosystems.¡/p¿}
