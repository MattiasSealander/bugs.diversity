  abstract = {Abstract Univariate and multivariate methods are commonly used to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological communities, but each has limitations, including oversimplification or abstraction of communities. Rank abundance curves (RACs) potentially integrate these existing methodologies by detailing species-level community changes. Here, we had three goals: first, to simplify analysis of community dynamics by developing a coordinated set of R functions, and second, to demystify the relationships among univariate, multivariate, and RACs measures, and examine how each is influenced by the community parameters as well as data collection methods. We developed new functions for studying temporal changes and spatial differences in RACs in an update to the R package library(“codyn”), alongside other new functions to calculate univariate and multivariate measures of community dynamics. We also developed a new approach to studying changes in the shape of RAC curves. The R package update presented here increases the accessibility of univariate and multivariate measures of community change over time and difference over space. Next, we use simulated and real data to assess the RAC and multivariate measures that are output from our new functions, studying (1) if they are influenced by species richness and evenness, temporal turnover, and spatial variability and (2) how the measures are related to each other. Lastly, we explore the use of the measures with an example from a long-term nutrient addition experiment. We find that the RAC and multivariate measures are not sensitive to species richness and evenness and that all the measures detail unique aspects of temporal change or spatial differences. We also find that species reordering is the strongest correlate of a multivariate measure of compositional change and explains most community change observed in long-term nutrient addition experiment. Overall, we show that species reordering is potentially an understudied determinant of community changes over time or differences between treatments. The functions developed here should enhance the use of RACs to further explore the dynamics of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without  replacement), which is the current standard method for normalization, has been  widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the  community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers  explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. Here we introduce a  normalization method for species count data called scaling with ranked  subsampling (SRS) and demonstrate its suitability for the analysis of microbial  communities. METHODS: SRS consists of two steps. In the scaling step, the counts  for all species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are divided by a scaling  factor chosen in such a way that the sum of scaled counts equals the selected  total number of counts C(min). The relative frequencies of all OTUs remain  unchanged. In the subsequent ranked subsampling step, non-integer count values  are converted into integers by an algorithm that minimizes subsampling error with  regard to the population structure (relative frequencies of species or OTUs)  while keeping the total number of counts equal C(min). SRS and rarefying were  compared by normalizing a test library representing a soil bacterial community.  Common parameters of biodiversity and population structure (Shannon index H',  species richness, species composition, and relative abundances of OTUs) were  determined for libraries normalized to different size by rarefying as well as SRS  with 10,000 replications each. An implementation of SRS in R is available for  download (https://doi.org/10.20387/BONARES-2657-1NP3). RESULTS: SRS showed  greater reproducibility and preserved OTU frequencies and alpha diversity better  than rarefying. The variance in Shannon diversity increased with the reduction of  the library size after rarefying but remained zero for SRS. Relative abundances  of OTUs strongly varied among libraries generated by rarefying, whereas libraries  normalized by SRS showed only negligible variation. Bray-Curtis index of  dissimilarity among replicates of the same library normalized by rarefying  revealed a large variation in species composition, which reached complete  dissimilarity (not a single OTU shared) among some libraries rarefied to a small  size. The dissimilarity among replicated libraries normalized by SRS remained  negligibly low at each library size. The variance in dissimilarity increased with  the decreasing library size after rarefying, whereas it remained either zero or  negligibly low after SRS. CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of OTU or species counts by  scaling with ranked subsampling preserves the original community structure by  minimizing subsampling errors. We therefore propose SRS for the normalization of  biological count data.},

  abstractNote={A significant number of archaeology’s Grand Challenges (Kintigh et al. 2014) can only be addressed through access to large amounts of data from multiple research fields, and advanced tools for aggregating, synthesizing and analyzing them. Archaeological research has seen significant developments in the use of databases and database tools since first adopting them in the late 1960s (Lock 2003). The often small scale of archaeological budgets, and the paucity of long-term funding, has meant that cheaper solutions have most often been used. These have ranged from mainstream database management systems through university site licenses and project specific purchases, to independently coded solutions and more recent open source alternatives. The relatively unusual nature and complexity of archaeological science (see Lidén 2017) data has meant that custom database designs have been the norm. The vast majority of these databases have been built to serve single purposes: from simple sample processing archives, to more complete excavation databases or multi-site macrofossil databases. User interfaces, if present, usually reflect these aims rather than provide for wider audiences. Such databases are an extremely important part of how science is now conducted, and, as explained in this chapter, there are considerable advantages to upscaling them towards becoming components in research infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Summary The compositional complexity of an assemblage is not expressible as a single number; standard measures such as diversities (Hill numbers) and entropies (Rényi entropies and Tsallis entropies) vary in their order q which determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species. Ranking and comparing assemblages depend on the choice of q. Rather than selecting one or a few measures to describe an assemblage, it is preferable to convey the complete story by presenting a continuous profile, a plot of diversity or entropy as a function of q ≥ 0. This makes it easy to visually compare the compositional complexities of multiple assemblages and to judge the evenness of the relative abundance distributions of the assemblages. In practice, the profile is plotted for all values of q from 0 to q = 3 or 4 (beyond which it generally changes little). These profiles are usually generated by substituting species sample proportions into the complexity measures. However, this empirical approach typically underestimates the true profile for low values of q, because samples usually miss some of the assemblage's species due to under-sampling. Although bias-reduction methods exist for individual measures of order q = 0, 1 and 2, there has been no analytic method that unifies these bias-corrected estimates into a continuous profile. For incomplete sampling data, this work proposes a novel analytic method to obtain accurate, continuous, low-bias diversity and entropy profiles with focus on low orders of q (0 ≤ q ≤ 3). Our approach is based on reformulating the diversity and entropy of any order q in terms of the successive discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. A bootstrap method is applied to obtain approximate variances of our proposed profiles and to construct the associated confidence intervals. Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that the proposed profiles greatly reduce under-sampling bias and have substantially lower bias and mean-squared error than the empirical profile, especially for q ≤ 1. Our method is also extended to deal with incidence data.},

We used pollen data to test if such a change in the latitudinal diversity gradient occurred during the last major poleward shift of plant species in Europe following the end of the last glacial period. In contrast to expectations, the slope of the gradient strengthened during the Holocene. The increase in temperatures around 10\,ka ago reduced diversity at mid to high latitude sites due to the gradual closure of forests. Deforestation and the introduction of agriculture during the last 5\,ky had a greater impact on richness in central Europe than the earlier climate warming. These results do not support the current view that global warming alone will lead to a loss in biodiversity, and demonstrate that non-climatic human impacts on the latitudinal diversity gradient is of a greater magnitude than climate change.}

  abstract = {Abstract Severe losses of insects have taken place over major parts of Europe. This negative trend is assumed to be largely the result of agricultural intensification. To analyse potential factors causing this loss of species, we assessed butterfly communities at 21 grassland patches. Seventeen of these were distributed across an agricultural landscape dominated by crop fields; four were embedded in two adjoining managed semi-natural grassland areas. We assessed environmental parameters such as patch size and habitat quality for each grassland patch. We further incorporated the surrounding land-cover considering different degrees of land-use intensity. We classified butterfly species into generalists and specialists according their ecological and behavioural characteristics. As in the managed semi-natural reference grasslands, species richness and abundance were higher in patches surrounded by extensively used grasslands and unsprayed crop fields, and lower in patches surrounded by sprayed crop fields. Furthermore, blossom density positively affected butterfly occurrence. Our data revealed that specialised butterfly species mainly occur in managed semi-natural grassland sites, and are largely absent from other grassland plots embedded in the agricultural matrix. Our study underlines the negative impacts of intense conventional agriculture on butterfly species richness and abundance and reveals the urgent need for more nature-friendly cultivation methods. In situ experiments may help to understand and disentangle single drivers causing this negative trend.},

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

  abstract = {Background
  Systematic reviews (SRs) are useful tools in synthesising the available evidence, but high numbers of overlapping SRs are also discussed in the context of research waste. Although it is often claimed that the number of SRs being published is increasing steadily, there are no precise data on that. We aimed to assess trends in the epidemiology and reporting of published SRs over the last 20 years.
  Methods
  A retrospective observational study was conducted to identify potentially eligible SRs indexed in PubMed from 2000 to 2019. From all 572,871 records retrieved, we drew a simple random sample of 4,000. The PRISMA-P definition of SRs was applied to full texts and only SRs published in English were included. Characteristics were extracted by one reviewer, with a 20% sample verified by a second person.
  Results
  A total of 1,132 SRs published in 710 different journals were included. The estimated number of SRs indexed in 2000 was 1,432 (95% CI: 547–2,317), 5,013 (95% CI: 3,375–6,650) in 2010 and 29,073 (95% CI: 25,445–32,702) in 2019. Transparent reporting of key items increased over the years. About 7 out of 10 named their article a SR (2000–2004: 41.9% and 2015–2019: 74.4%). In 2000–2004, 32.3% of SRs were based in the UK (0% in China), in 2015–2019 24.0% were from China and 10.8% from the UK. Nearly all articles from China (94.9%) conducted a meta-analysis (overall: 58.9%). Cochrane reviews (n = 84; 7.4%) less often imposed language restrictions, but often did not report the number of records and full texts screened and did not name their article a SR (22.6% vs. 73.4%).
  Conclusions
  We observed a more than 20-fold increase in the number of SRs indexed over the last 20 years. In 2019, this is equivalent to 80 SRs per day. Over time, SRs got more diverse in respect to journals, type of review, and country of corresponding authors. The high proportion of meta-analyses from China needs further investigation.

However, the number of reports documenting other types of range shifts – such as in east-west directions across longitudes or, even more unexpectedly, towards tropical latitudes and lower elevations – is increasing rapidly. Recent studies show that these range shifts may not be so unexpected once the local climate changes are accounted for. We here provide an updated synthesis of the fast-moving research on climate-related range shifts. By describing the current state of the art on geographical patterns of species range shifts under contemporary climate change for plants and animals across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we identified a number of research shortfalls. In addition to the recognised geographic shortfall in the tropics, we found taxonomic and methodological shortfalls with knowledge gaps regarding range shifts of prokaryotes, lowland range shifts of terrestrial plants, and bathymetric range shifts of marine plants. Based on this review, we provide a research agenda for filling these gaps. We outline a comprehensive framework for assessing multidimensional changes in species distributions, which should then be contrasted with expectations based on climate change indices, such as velocity measures accounting for complex local climate changes. Finally, we propose a unified classification of geographical patterns of species range shifts, arranged in a bi-dimensional space defined by species’ persistence and movement rates. Placing the observed and expected shifts into this bi-dimensional space should lead to more informed assessments of extinction risks.},

  abstract = {Author Summary The term microbiome refers to the ecosystem of microbes that live in a defined environment. The decreasing cost and increasing speed of DNA sequencing technology has recently provided scientists with affordable and timely access to the genes and genomes of microbiomes that inhabit our planet and even our own bodies. In these investigations many microbiome samples are sequenced at the same time on the same DNA sequencing machine, but often result in total numbers of sequences per sample that are vastly different. The common procedure for addressing this difference in sequencing effort across samples – different library sizes – is to either (1) base analyses on the proportional abundance of each species in a library, or (2) rarefy, throw away sequences from the larger libraries so that all have the same, smallest size. We show that both of these normalization methods can work when comparing obviously-different whole microbiomes, but that neither method works well when comparing the relative proportions of each bacterial species across microbiome samples. We show that alternative methods based on a statistical mixture model perform much better and can be easily adapted from a separate biological sub-discipline, called RNA-Seq analysis.}

  abstract = {In the 12,000 years preceding the Industrial Revolution, human activities led to significant changes in land cover, plant and animal distributions, surface hydrology, and biochemical cycles. Earth system models suggest that this anthropogenic land cover change influenced regional and global climate. However, the representation of past land use in earth system models is currently oversimplified. As a result, there are large uncertainties in the current understanding of the past and current state of the earth system. In order to improve representation of the variety and scale of impacts that past land use had on the earth system, a global effort is underway to aggregate and synthesize archaeological and historical evidence of land use systems. Here we present a simple, hierarchical classification of land use systems designed to be used with archaeological and historical data at a global scale and a schema of codes that identify land use practices common to a range of systems, both implemented in a geospatial database. The classification scheme and database resulted from an extensive process of consultation with researchers worldwide. Our scheme is designed to deliver consistent, empirically robust data for the improvement of land use models, while simultaneously allowing for a comparative, detailed mapping of land use relevant to the needs of historical scholars. To illustrate the benefits of the classification scheme and methods for mapping historical land use, we apply it to Mesopotamia and Arabia at 6 kya (c. 4000 BCE). The scheme will be used to describe land use by the Past Global Changes (PAGES) LandCover6k working group, an international project comprised of archaeologists, historians, geographers, paleoecologists, and modelers. Beyond this, the scheme has a wide utility for creating a common language between research and policy communities, linking archaeologists with climate modelers, biodiversity conservation workers and initiatives.},

We applied a network  modelling approach to the recent fossil record of northwestern European beetles  to investigate how their taxonomic and trait composition changed during the past  16 000 years. We found two major changes in beetle faunas 4000-3500 and 10  000-9500 years ago, coinciding with periods of human population growth in the  Late Holocene and climate warming in the Early Holocene. Our results demonstrate  that humans have affected insect biodiversity since at least the introduction of  agropastoralism, with landscape-scale effects that can be observed at sites away  from areas of direct human impact.},

Although the usefulness of meta-analyses depends on their reliability, such as the precision of individual and mean effect sizes, attempts to reproduce meta-analyses’ results remain rare in ecology and evolution. Here, we assess the reliability of 41 meta-analyses on sexual signals by evaluating the reproducibility and replicability of their results. We attempted to: (i) reproduce meta-analyses’ mean effect sizes using the datasets they provided; (ii) reproduce meta-analyses’ effect sizes by re-extracting 5703 effect sizes from 246 primary studies they used as sources; (iii) assess the extent of relevant data missed by original meta-analyses; and (iv) replicate meta-analyses’ mean effect sizes after incorporating re-extracted and relevant missing data. We found many discrepancies between meta-analyses’ reported results and those generated by our analyses for all reproducibility and replicability attempts. Nonetheless, we argue that the meta-analyses we evaluated are largely reproducible and replicable because the differences we found were small in magnitude, leaving the original interpretation of these meta-analyses’ results unchanged. Still, we highlight issues we observed in these meta-analyses that affected their reliability, providing recommendations to ameliorate them. }

  abstract = {Major declines in insect biomass and diversity, reviewed here, have become obvious and well documented since the end of World War II. Here, we conclude that the spread and intensification of agriculture during the past half century is directly related to these losses. In addition, many areas, including tropical mountains, are suffering serious losses because of climate change as well. Crops currently occupy about 11\% of the world’s land surface, with active grazing taking place over an additional 30\%. The industrialization of agriculture during the second half of the 20th century involved farming on greatly expanded scales, monoculturing, the application of increasing amounts of pesticides and fertilizers, and the elimination of interspersed hedgerows and other wildlife habitat fragments, all practices that are destructive to insect and other biodiversity in and near the fields. Some of the insects that we are destroying, including pollinators and predators of crop pests, are directly beneficial to the crops. In the tropics generally, natural vegetation is being destroyed rapidly and often replaced with export crops such as oil palm and soybeans. To mitigate the effects of the Sixth Mass Extinction event that we have caused and are experiencing now, the following will be necessary: a stable (and almost certainly lower) human population, sustainable levels of consumption, and social justice that empowers the less wealthy people and nations of the world, where the vast majority of us live, will be necessary.}

By the use of this technique, a within-habitat analysis was made of the bivalve and polychaete components of soft-bottom marine faunas which differed in latitude, depth, temperature, and salinity. The resulting diversity values were highly correlated with the physical stability and past history of these environments. A stability-time hypothesis was invoked to fit these findings, and, with this hypothesis, predictions were made about the diversities present in certain other environments as yet unstudied. The two types of diversity, based on numerical percentage composition and on number of species, were compared and shown to be poorly correlated with each other. Our data indicated that species number is the more valid diversity measurement. The rarefaction methodology was compared with a number of diversity indexes using identical data. Many of these indexes were markedly influenced by sample size. Good agreement was found between the rarefaction methodology and the Shannon-Wiener information function.]}

The anthropogenic loss of species diversity happening now is often discussed as the ‘sixth mass extinction’ in light of the ‘Big Five’ mass extinctions in the fossil record. But insects, whose taxonomic diversity now appears to be threatened by human activity, have a unique extinction history. Prehistoric losses of insect diversity at the levels of order and family appear to have been driven by competition among insect lineages, with biotic replacement ensuring minimal net losses in taxonomic diversity. The end-Permian extinction, the ‘mother of mass extinctions’ in the seas, was more of a faunal turnover than a mass extinction for insects. Insects’ current biotic crisis has been measured in terms of the loss of abundance and biomass (rather than the loss of species, genera, or families) and these are essentially impossible to measure in the fossil record. However, should the ongoing loss of insect abundance and biomass cause the demise of many insect families, the current extinction event may well be the first sudden loss of higher-level insect diversity in our planet’s history. This is not insects’ sixth mass extinction—in fact, it may become their first.},

  abstract = {Ancient human DNA (aDNA) extracted from archaeological contexts allows reconstructing past population movements. Previous methods work by calculating proportions of shared ancestry among individuals or groups in order to answer specific, regional research questions. Here, we propose a large-scale algorithm to quantify human mobility through time and space using bulk aDNA data. The algorithm has two core components: i) interpolation of the spatiotemporal distribution of genetic ancestry to obtain a continuous ancestry information field and ii) probabilistic estimation of a spatial genetic similarity surface for each input sample by projecting its ancestry profile into this field. We apply this to thousands of published genomic samples in the last 10,000 y to trace diachronic mobility patterns in Western Eurasia. The recent increase in openly available ancient human DNA samples allows for large-scale meta-analysis applications. Trans-generational past human mobility is one of the key aspects that ancient genomics can contribute to since changes in genetic ancestry—unlike cultural changes seen in the archaeological record—necessarily reflect movements of people. Here, we present an algorithm for spatiotemporal mapping of genetic profiles, which allow for direct estimates of past human mobility from large ancient genomic datasets. The key idea of the method is to derive a spatial probability surface of genetic similarity for each individual in its respective past. This is achieved by first creating an interpolated ancestry field through space and time based on multivariate statistics and Gaussian process regression and then using this field to map the ancient individuals into space according to their genetic profile. We apply this algorithm to a dataset of 3138 aDNA samples with genome-wide data from Western Eurasia in the last 10,000 y. Finally, we condense this sample-wise record with a simple summary statistic into a diachronic measure of mobility for subregions in Western, Central, and Southern Europe. For regions and periods with sufficient data coverage, our similarity surfaces and mobility estimates show general concordance with previous results and provide a meta-perspective of genetic changes and human mobility.}

Environmentally transformative human use of land accelerated with the emergence of agriculture, but the extent, trajectory, and implications of these early changes are not well understood. An empirical global assessment of land use from 10,000 years before the present (yr B.P.) to 1850 CE reveals a planet largely transformed by hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists by 3000 years ago, considerably earlier than the dates in the land-use reconstructions commonly used by Earth scientists. Synthesis of knowledge contributed by more than 250 archaeologists highlighted gaps in archaeological expertise and data quality, which peaked for 2000 yr B.P. and in traditionally studied and wealthier regions. Archaeological reconstruction of global land-use history illuminates the deep roots of Earth’s transformation and challenges the emerging Anthropocene paradigm that large-scale anthropogenic global environmental change is mostly a recent phenomenon.}

However, they found that freshwater insect populations have increased overall, perhaps owing to clean water efforts and climate change. Patterns of variation suggest that local-scale drivers are likely responsible for many changes in population trends, providing hope for directed conservation actions. Science, this issue p. 417; see also p. 368 Global changes in insect populations reflect both decline and growth. Recent case studies showing substantial declines of insect abundances have raised alarm, but how widespread such patterns are remains unclear. We compiled data from 166 long-term surveys of insect assemblages across 1676 sites to investigate trends in insect abundances over time. Overall, we found considerable variation in trends even among adjacent sites but an average decline of terrestrial insect abundance by ~9\% per decade and an increase of freshwater insect abundance by ~11\% per decade. Both patterns were largely driven by strong trends in North America and some European regions. We found some associations with potential drivers (e.g., land-use drivers), and trends in protected areas tended to be weaker. Our findings provide a more nuanced view of spatiotemporal patterns of insect abundance trends than previously suggested.}

  abstract = {Abstract Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem functioning, habitat recovery following disturbance and resilience to global environmental change. Long-term ecological records can be used to explore biodiversity patterns and trends over centennial to multi-millennial time-scales across broad regions. Fossil pollen grains preserved in sediment over millennia reflect palynological richness and diversity, which relates to changes in landscape diversity. Other long-term environmental data, such as fossil insects, palaeoclimate and archaeologically inferred palaeodemographic (population) data, hold potential to address questions about the drivers and consequences of diversity change when combined with fossil pollen records. This study tests a model of Holocene palynological diversity change through a synthesis of pollen and insect records from across the British Isles along with palaeodemographic trends and palaeoclimate records. We demonstrate relationships between human population change, insect faunal group turnover, palynological diversity and climate trends through the Holocene. Notable increases in population at the start of the British Neolithic (~6,000 calendar years before present [bp]) and Bronze Age (~4,200 bp) coincided with the loss of forests, increased agricultural activity and changes in insect faunal groups to species associated with human land use. Pollen diversity and evenness increased, most notably since the Bronze Age, as landscapes became more open and heterogeneous. However, regionally distinctive patterns are also evident within the context of these broad-scale trends. Palynological diversity is correlated with population while diversity and population are correlated with some climate datasets during certain time periods (e.g. Greenland temperature in the mid-late Holocene). Synthesis. This study has demonstrated that early human societies contributed to shaping palynological diversity patterns over millennia within the context of broader climatic influences upon vegetation. The connections between population and palynological diversity become increasingly significant in the later Holocene, implying intensifying impacts of human activity, which may override climatic effects. Patterns of palynological diversity trends are regionally variable and do not always follow expected trajectories. To fully understand the long-term drivers of biodiversity change on regionally relevant ecological and management scales, future research needs to focus on amalgamating diverse data types, along with multi-community efforts to harmonise data across broad regions.},

  abstract = {Investigating ecological networks can help us to understand how ecosystems respond to environmental changes. The increasing number of ecological network studies has facilitated the emergence of a body of meta-analyses that aims to generalize geographical patterns of ecological interactions. Here we summarize the status, potential shortcomings, and challenges in meta-analyses of ecological networks. We emphasize the importance of this approach and how it can be developed in the future. This ongoing ecological network meta-analytical approach will continue to generate important insights into existing patterns in global ecological networks and enhance our knowledge of future global change impacts on ecosystems.}
